# Book Recommendation
##About the project

Though the Web was originally conceived to be used by human users, new data-oriented content have been produced and made available on the Web with the introduction and development of the [Semantic Web idea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web). In particular,
more recently there has been a growing interest in the [Linked Open Data (LOD) initiative](http://linkeddata.org). The cornerstone of Linked Open Data is making available free and open RDF datasets linked with each other. 

The aim of this project is to create **a book recommender system**. The idea is to implement a system that will generate a list of a suggested books to read for a selected book. The project was inspired by the paper by Mirizzi et al [1], where authors describe a web application for movie recommendation based on movie's attributes.

The project workflow consists of the following steps:
*	Collecting data from [DBPedia](http://wiki.dbpedia.org/) and preprocessing
*	Building recommendation system
*	Implementation
*	Technical realisation

##Collecting data from DBPedia and preprocessing

Datasets used in this project are extracted from the DBpedia, the RDF-based version of Wikipedia. [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/)(Resource Description Framework) is a standard model for data interchange on the Web. For searching DBPedia we have used [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/) (The Simple Protocol and RDF Query Language), which makes possible to ask complex queries to DBpedia.

The example of a SPARQL query for extracting the data is displayed in the Listing 1. Books are filtered by movements of their authors. Only books that have all of their attributes values in English are considered and used for the recommender system. In the *SELECT* part of the query, attributes required for the dataset are listed.

##Building recommendation system

###Vector Space Model

In order to compute the similarities, [VSM (Vector Space Model)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space_model) is implemented. In VSM non-binary weights are assigned to index terms in queries and in documents (represented as sets of terms), and are used to compute the degree of similarity between each document in the collection and the query. [1]

Book attributes that are used as a base for recommendation are:
* author_name - name of a book's author,
* genre - a genre of a book,
* author_movement - the literary movement of a book's author.

So, the goal is to create a vector of values for thw listed atributes for every book and calculate its similarity score with vectors of all other books in the dataset.

To increase precision, it's recommanded to use TFIDF values for creating vectors. TF(term-frequency) is a measure of how many times the terms present in vocabulary E(*t*) are present in the documents, we define the term-frequency as a couting function [4]:

![tf](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=+++%5Cmathrm%7Btf%7D%28t%2Cd%29+%3D+%5Csum%5Climits_%7Bx%5Cin+d%7D+%5Cmathrm%7Bfr%7D%28x%2C+t%29+++&bg=ffffff&fg=000000&s=0)

where the fr(*x, t*) is a simple function defined as:

![fr](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=+++%5Cmathrm%7Bfr%7D%28x%2Ct%29+%3D+++%5Cbegin%7Bcases%7D+++1%2C+%26+%5Cmbox%7Bif+%7D+x+%3D+t+%5C%5C+++0%2C+%26+%5Cmbox%7Botherwise%7D+%5C%5C+++%5Cend%7Bcases%7D+++&bg=ffffff&fg=000000&s=0)


In *Listing 3*, the code snippet for calculating *tf value* for *genre* attribute, is shown.
```java
public double calculateGenreTF(Book mainBook, Book book) {
	double tf = 0;
		
	for(int i = 0; i < book.getGenres().size(); i++) {
		for(int j = 0; j < mainBook.getGenres().size(); j++) {
			if(book.getGenres().get(i).equals(mainBook.getGenres().get(j))) {
				tf++;
			}
		}
	}
		
	return tf/book.getGenres().size();
}
```
*Listing 3 - Java code for calculating tf*

Some terms may be very common, so we use IDF (Inverse Document Frequency) which diminishes the weight of terms that occur very frequently in the document set and increases the weight of terms that occur rarely. In context of book recommendation, it's obvious that *author_name* attribute is more relevant for recommending system then *author_movement* attribute, because there are many more books that belongs to *Literary realism* movement then books writen by *Fyodor Dostoyevsky*. IDF is calculated according to next formula:

![idf](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ac67bc0f76b5b8e31e842d6b7d28f8949dab7937)

with

*  **N**: total number of documents in the corpus **N** = **|D|**
* **|{d in D : t in d}|** : number of documents where the term **t** appears. 

In *Listing 4*, a snippet of Java code for calculating *idf* values for *author_name* attribute, is displayed.
```java
public double calculateAuthorIDF(Book mainBook, Book book) {
	int counter = 0;
	for (Book b : books) {
		if (b.getAuthorName().equals(mainBook.getAuthorName())) {
			counter++;
		}
	}
	
	return Math.log10((books.size() * 1.0) / (counter * 1.0));
}
```
*Listing 4 - Java code for calculating idf*

Now, if input for recommender is a book [Crime And Punishment](http://dbpedia.org/page/Crime_and_Punishment), some of the book vectors for this and other books will look like in *Listing 5*.
```
Crime and Punishment (1.9594083500800643, 1.505149978319906, 1.541872785344646)
The Brothers Karamazov (1.9594083500800643, 0.752574989159953, 1.541872785344646)
The Village of Stepanchikovo (1.9594083500800643, 0.0, 1.541872785344646)
```
*Listing 5 - Vector examples*


### Cosine similarity

[The cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) between two vectors (or two documents in the Vector Space) is a measure that calculates the cosine of the angle between them. This metric is a measurement of orientation and not magnitude, it can be seen as a comparison between documents on a normalized space. The equation for calculating cosine similarity is depicted in *Figure 1* [2]:

![equation](http://cs.carleton.edu/cs_comps/0910/netflixprize/final_results/knn/img/knn/cos.png "Figure 1 - Cosine similarity equation") *Figure 1 - Cosine similarity equation*

The dividend is a dot product of those vectors, and the divisor is a product of vector intensities. Cosine Similarity will generate a metric that says how related are two documents by looking at the angle instead of magnitude. So, the more the result is closer to 1, two vectors (documents/books) are more similar. On the other hand, if the result tends to 0, it means that vectors are opposed (the angle between them is 90 degrees). [3]

In the *Listing 6*, Java code for calculating cosine similarity is given.
```java
public double calculateCosineSimilarity(double[] vector1, double[] vector2) {
	double firstElement = 0;
	double secondElement = 0;
	double thirdElement = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < vector1.length; i++) {
		firstElement = firstElement + vector1[i] * vector2[i];
		secondElement = secondElement + vector1[i] * vector1[i];
		thirdElement = thirdElement + vector2[i] * vector2[i];
	}
	if(Math.sqrt(secondElement) * Math.sqrt(thirdElement) == 0 || Double.isNaN(Math.sqrt(secondElement) * 		Math.sqrt(thirdElement))) {
		return 0;
	}
	double result = firstElement / (Math.sqrt(secondElement) * Math.sqrt(thirdElement));
	return result;
}
```
*Listing 6 - Cosine similarity calculating in Java*

If this is invoked for the example from thw previous section, the program will generate a result as in the *Listing 7*.
```
Crime and Punishment: 1.0
The Brothers Karamazov: 0.9689186192323702
The Village of Stepanchikovo: 0.8561026924522617
```
*Listing 7 - Cosine similarity values for given vectors*

## Implementation

This recommender system accepts two parameters for every recommendation, a book and a number of recommendations to be displayed.
```java
List<Book> lb = Controler.getInstance().getRecommendedBooks(mainBook, 20);
```
*Listing 8 - Starting the system from main class*

For the input book "Crime and Punishment" by Dostoyevsky, the system will build vectors for every book from the dataset (with calculation of *tfidf* values for its attributes, as it is shown in previous chapter), and then calculate cosine similarity between selected book and every other book from dataset:
```java
for (int i = 0; i < books.size(); i++) {
	BookVector compareVector = new BookVector(mainBook, books.get(i), (ArrayList<Book>) books);
	double value = cosineSimilarityCalculator.calculateCosineSimilarity(vectorMain.getBookVector(),compareVector.getBookVector());
	ValuedBook valuedBook = new ValuedBook(books.get(i), value);
	valuedBooks.add(valuedBook);
}

...

VectorBuilder vb = new VectorBuilder(books);
attributeVector = vb.createVector(mainBook, book);

...

public double[] createVector(Book mainBook, Book book) {
	bookAuthor = tfidfCalculator.calculateAuthorTFIDF(mainBook, book);
	bookGenre = tfidfCalculator.calculateGenreTDIDF(mainBook, book);
	authorMovement = tfidfCalculator.calculateMovementTFIDF(mainBook, book);
	double[] attributeVector = new double[3];
	attributeVector[0] = bookAuthor;
	attributeVector[1] = bookGenre;
	attributeVector[2] = authorMovement;
	return attributeVector;
}

//Vector creation is explained in previous section

```
*Listing 9 - The program flow*

*VauedBook* is a class with two attributes, *book* and *value*, which represents a cosine similarity value added to this specific book.
At the end, recommended books are displayed sorted by recommendation score:

```
